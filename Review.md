# Music Theory Review

## The Notes
(A) (A\#/Bb) (B) (C) (C\#/Db) (D) (D\#/Eb) (E) (F) (F\#/Gb) (G) (G\#/Ab)  
Tip : B->C and E->F have direct paths (no sharps or flats)

##Steps + Intervals
**Half-step**: Moving from one note to the very next note in the key is a half step. Move one fret on the guitar  
**Whole-step**: Equivalent to two half steps. Move two frets on the guitar  
**Interval**: The distance between two notes  
  
**Sharp**: symbolized as a note followed by \#. Sharpened notes are one half step-up from the note they are attached to.  
**Flat**: symbolized as a note followed by b. Flattened notes are one half-step down from the note they are attached to.   

##Signatures + Scales + Keys
**Key Signature**: Notes you choose to include in your music. Sharps or Flats in the Key - Defines the set of notes in a key.  
**Scale**: Inclusion of these notes in an ascending or descending order.  
If a Song or a section of music only uses the major scale, then you are only playing in that major scale's key  
Key of a song in G Major = F#  

##What you should know of keys
- How to figure out what notes are in a key and state key signature
- Know that every major key has a related minor key
- Know the order of sharps and flats as they appear in key signatures  

### Example
Eb Major Scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb  
Key Signature: Eb Ab Bb  

##Major Scale
**Formula**:  
1-2 = W  
2-3 = W  
3-4 = h  
4-5 = W  
5-6 = W  
6-7 = W  
7-8 = h  
  
| **Major Scale Formula**     | W  W  h  W  W  W  h    |
| --------|--------- |
| **G Major Scale** | A  B  C  D  E  F# G |  
| **A Major Scale** | B  C# D  E  F# G# A |  
| **D Major Scale** | E  F# G  A  B  C# D |  
| **C Major Scale** | D  E  F  G  A  B  C |  

##Relatives
All Major/Minor scales have a relative Minor/Major associated with the respected scale

### Examples
- C Major - A Minor
- G Major - E Minor
- D Major - B Minor
- A Major - F# Minor
- E Major - C# Minor

##Tonal Center
**Tonal Center**: Home base note.  
- C Major and A Minor are essentially the same scale (set of notes)  
- However, A minor prioritizes A as the Tonal Center, where C Major prioritizes C as the Tonal Center  
- These two scales have the same key signature and are therefore, relatives  
- The relative minor of a major, say C Major, is the sixth note, in this case A  

##Minor Scale
**Formula**:  
1-2 W  
2-3 h  
3-4 W  
4-5 W  
5-6 h  
6-7 W  
7-8 W  

| **Minor Scale Formula**     | W  h  W  W  h  W  W |
| --------|--------- |
| **G Minor Scale** | G  A  Bb C  D  Eb F  G |  
| **A Minor Scale** | A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A |  

##Intervals
**Intervals between notes in a scale**:  
1-1 = unison  
1-2 = major 2nd  
1-3 = major 3rd  
1-4 = perfect 4th  
1-5 = perfect 5th  
1-6 = major 6th  
1-7 = major 7th  
1-8 = octave  

### Example
What is a major 3rd up from D?  

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 3 |  
| --------|---------|--------- |---------|--------- |---------|---------|--------- |  
| D | E | F# | G | A | B | C# | F # |   

##Flatten or Sharpen Intervals
- flatten maj 2 => min 2
- flatten maj 3 => min 3
- sharpen maj 2 => aug 2
- sharpen maj 3 => aug 3
- flatten perfect 4th => diminished 4th
- flatten perfect 5th => diminished 5th
- sharpen perfect 4th => augmented 4th
- sharpen perfect 5th => augmented 5th
  
###Example
- C -> D = Major 2nd
- C -> Db = Minor 2nd
- C -> D# = Augmented 2nd

##Chords
**Chord**: Three or more unique notes played in unison.  
**Triad**: Chords with three notes stacked in thirds    

##Major Triad
**Major Triad**: A triad composed of the root, the major 3rd, and the perfect 5th
- C Major Triad = C E G (1-3-5)  
- C -> E = Major 3rd  
- E -> G = Minor 3rd 
- has major 3rd (C -> E)
- has perfect 5th (C -> G)

##Minor Triad
**Minor Triad**: A triad composed of the root, the minor 3rd, and the perfect 5th  
- C Minor Triad = C Eb G
- has minor 3rd (C -> Eb)
- has perfect 5th (C -> G)

##Augmented Triad
**Augmented Triad**: A triad composed of the root, the major 3rd, and the augmented 5th
- C Augmented Triad = C E G#
- has a major 3rd (C -> E)
- has a augmented 5th (C -> G#)

##Diminished Triad
**Diminished Triad**: A triad composed of the root, the minor 3rd, and the diminished 5th
- C Diminished Triad = C Eb Gb
- has a minor 3rd (C -> Eb)
- has a diminished 5th (C -> Gb)

##Four Note Chords
**Four Note Chords**: A triad combined with a 7th note in the scale.  
- C E G B ( Major triad + Major 7) Cmaj7
- C E G Bb (Major triad + Minor 7) C7 or Cdom7
- C Eb G Bb (Minor triad + Minor 7) Cmin7
- C Eb Gb Bb (Diminished triad + Minor 7) Cmin7 b5 (half diminished)
- C Eb Gb Bbb (Diminished triad + double flatted or diminished 7) CDim7 or fully diminished 

##Suspensions
**Suspending**: lower the thrid to major 2nd or raise the third to perfect 4th  
- 1 3 5 => 1 2 5 or 1 4 5
- CSus2 = suspended third to major 2nd
- CSus4 = suspended third to perfect 4th

##Sixth Chords
**Sixth Chords**: Replace the perfect 5th in the triad with a major 6th. Can be Maj/Min depending on the 3rd.  
- C6 : C E G => C E A
- Cmin6 : C E G => C Eb A

##Tensions
**Tension**: Adding the 2nd(9), 4th(11), or 6th(13) note in the scale to the chord.  
- Cmaj7 = C E G B
- Cmaj7(9) = Cmaj7 + 2 = C E G B D
- ( Not to be confused with suspensions where we replace the 3rd with the 2nd - We Are Adding!)
- Cmaj7(11) = Cmaj7 + 4 = C E G B F

###Altering Tensions (Sharpen or Flatten the Tension)
- D7(9) = D F# A C B
- So, D7(#9) (D7 sharp 9) = D F# A C B#
- D7(b13) = D F# A C Bb
