# Music Theory Review

## The Notes
(A) (A\#/Bb) (B) (C) (C\#/Db) (D) (D\#/Eb) (E) (F) (F\#/Gb) (G) (G\#/Ab)  
Tip : B->C and E->F have direct paths (no sharps or flats)

##Steps + Intervals
**Half-step**: Moving from one note to the very next note in the key is a half step. Move one fret on the guitar  
**Whole-step**: Equivalent to two half steps. Move two frets on the guitar  
**Interval**: The distance between two notes  
  
**Sharp**: symbolized as a note followed by \#. Sharpened notes are one half step-up from the note they are attached to.  
**Flat**: symbolized as a note followed by b. Flattened notes are one half-step down from the note they are attached to.   

##Signatures + Scales + Keys
**Key Signature**: Notes you choose to include in your music. Sharps or Flats in the Key - Defines the set of notes in a key.  
**Scale**: Inclusion of these notes in an ascending or descending order.  
If a Song or a section of music only uses the major scale, then you are only playing in that major scale's key  
Key of a song in G Major = F#  

##What you should know of keys
- How to figure out what notes are in a key and state key signature
- Know that every major key has a related minor key
- Know the order of sharps and flats as they appear in key signatures  

### Example
Eb Major Scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb  
Key Signature: Eb Ab Bb  

##Major Scale
**Formula**:  
1-2 = W  
2-3 = W  
3-4 = h  
4-5 = W  
5-6 = W  
6-7 = W  
7-8 = h  
  
| **Major Scale Formula**     | W  W  h  W  W  W  h    |
| --------|--------- |
| **G Major Scale** | A  B  C  D  E  F# G |  
| **A Major Scale** | B  C# D  E  F# G# A |  
| **D Major Scale** | E  F# G  A  B  C# D |  
| **C Major Scale** | D  E  F  G  A  B  C |  

##Relatives
All Major/Minor scales have a relative Minor/Major associated with the respected scale

### Examples
- C Major - A Minor
- G Major - E Minor
- D Major - B Minor
- A Major - F# Minor
- E Major - C# Minor

##Tonal Center
**Tonal Center**: Home base note.  
- C Major and A Minor are essentially the same scale (set of notes)  
- However, A minor prioritizes A as the Tonal Center, where C Major prioritizes C as the Tonal Center  
- These two scales have the same key signature and are therefore, relatives  
- The relative minor of a major, say C Major, is the sixth note, in this case A  

##Minor Scale
**Formula**:  
1-2 W  
2-3 h  
3-4 W  
4-5 W  
5-6 h  
6-7 W  
7-8 W  

| **Minor Scale Formula**     | W  h  W  W  h  W  W |
| --------|--------- |
| **G Minor Scale** | G  A  Bb C  D  Eb F  G |  
| **A Minor Scale** | A  B  C  D  E  F  G  A |  

##Intervals
**Intervals between notes in a scale**:  
1-1 = unison  
1-2 = major 2nd  
1-3 = major 3rd  
1-4 = perfect 4th  
1-5 = perfect 5th  
1-6 = major 6th  
1-7 = major 7th  
1-8 = octave  

### Example
What is a major 3rd up from D?  
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 3|  
| D | E | F# | G | A | B | C# | F # | 

##Flatten or Sharpen Intervals
- flatten Maj 2 => Min 2
- flatten Maj 3 => Min 3
- Sharpen Maj 2 => Aug 2
- Sharpen Maj 3 => Aug 3
  
- flatten perfect 4th => diminished 4th
- flatten perfect 5th => diminished 5th
- sharpen perfect 4th => augmented 4th
- sharpen perfect 5th => augmented 5th
  
###Example
- C -> D = Major 2nd
- C -> Db = Minor 2nd
- C -> D# = Augmented 2nd
