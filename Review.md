# Music Theory Review

## The Notes
(A) (A\#/Bb) (B) (C) (C\#/Db) (D) (D\#/Eb) (E) (F) (F\#/Gb) (G) (G\#/Ab)  
Tip : B->C and E->F have direct paths (no sharps or flats)

##Steps + Intervals
**Half-step**: Moving from one note to the very next note in the key is a half step. Move one fret on the guitar  
**Whole-step**: Equivalent to two half steps. Move two frets on the guitar  
**Interval**: The distance between two notes  
  
**Sharp**: symbolized as a note followed by \#. Sharpened notes are one half step-up from the note they are attached to.  
**Flat**: symbolized as a note followed by b. Flattened notes are one half-step down from the note they are attached to.   

##Signatures + Scales + Keys
**Key Signature**: Notes you choose to include in your music. Sharps or Flats in the Key - Defines the set of notes in a key.  
**Scale**: Inclusion of these notes in an ascending or descending order.  
If a Song or a section of music only uses the major scale, then you are only playing in that major scale's key  
Key of a song in G Major = F#  

##What you should know of keys
- How to figure out what notes are in a key and state key signature
- Know that every major key has a related minor key
- Know the order of sharps and flats as they appear in key signatures

##Major Scale
**Formula**:  
1-2 = W  
2-3 = W  
3-4 = h  
4-5 = W  
5-6 = W  
6-7 = W  
7-8 = h  
  
| **Major Scale Formula**     | W  W  h  W  W  W  h    |
| --------|--------- |
| **G Major Scale** | A  B  C  D  E  F# G |  
| **A Major Scale** | B  C# D  E  F# G# A |  
| **D Major Scale** | E  F# G  A  B  C# D |  
| **C Major Scale** | D  E  F  G nA  B  C |
