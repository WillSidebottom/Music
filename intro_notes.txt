Music Theory Notes:

[ These are the notes ]
(A) (A#/Bb) (B) (C) (C#/Db) (D) (D#/Eb) (E) (F) (F#/Gb) (G) (G#/Ab)
- Tip : B->C and E->F have direct paths (no sharps or flats)

[ These would be the black keys on the piano ]
# : sharp
b : flat

[ Steps + Intervals ]
half-step : Moving from one note to the very next note in the key is a half step. Move one fret on the guitar
whole-step : Skipping a note, moving two notes is a whole step. Move two frets on the guitar
interval : The distance between two notes

[ Sharping and Flatting]
Sharping : moving up one half step on a note
Flatting : moving down one half step

[ Key Signature ]
Key Signature - Notes you choose to include in your music
Scale - Inclusion of these notes in an ascending or descending order

[ Scales]
A Minor Scale - exclude all of the sharp and flat notes - A  B C  D  E F  G
One Octave - Playing the scale where original note is final note : A  B C  D  E F  G  A
C Major scale : C D E F G A B C

Formula:
1-2 = W
2-3 = W
3-4 = h
4-5 = W
5-6 = W
6-7 = W
7-8 = h

Major Scale Formula -    W  W  h  W  W  W  h
G Major Scale     	- G: A  B  C  D  E  F# G
A Major Scale		- A: B  C# D  E  F# G# A
D Major Scale       - D: E  F# G  A  B  C# D

[ Signatures and Keys ]
If a Song or a section of music only uses the major scale, then you are only playing in that major scale's key
Key Signature - Sharps or Flats in the Key - Defines the set of notes in a key
Scale - The order of the set played
Key of Song in G Major
Key Signature of G Major = F#

[ What you should know of keys ]
- How to figure out what notes are in a key and state key signature
- Know that every major key has a related minor key
- Know the order of sharps and flats as they appear in key signatures
Flatting : moving down one half step

[ Key Signature ]
Key Signature - Notes you choose to include in your music
Scale - Inclusion of these notes in an ascending or descending order

[ Scales]
A Minor Scale - exclude all of the sharp and flat notes - A  B C  D  E F  G
One Octave - Playing the scale where original note is final note : A  B C  D  E F  G  A
C Major scale : C D E F G A B C

Major Scale Formula:
1-2 = W
2-3 = W
3-4 = h
4-5 = W
5-6 = W
6-7 = W
8-8 = h

Major Scale Formula -    W  W  h  W  W  W  h
G Major Scale     	- G: A  B  C  D  E  F# G
A Major Scale		- A: B  C# D  E  F# G# A
D Major Scale       - D: E  F# G  A  B  C# D 
C Major Scale       - C: D  E  F  G nA  B  C

Key of Song in G Major
Key Signature of G Major = F#

[ What you should know of keys ]
Eb Major Scale: Eb F G Ab Bb C D Eb
Key Signature: Eb Ab Bb

Bb Major Scale: Bb C D Eb F G A Bb
Key SignatureL Bb Eb

[ Relatives ]
C Major - A Minor
G Major - E Minor
D Major - B Minor
A Major - F# Minor
E Major - C# Minor

Home Base Note = Tonal Center

C Major and A Minor are essentially the same scale (set of notes)
However, A minor prioritizes A as the Tonal Center, where C Major prioritizes C as the Tonal Center
These two scales have the same key signature and are therefor, relatives
The relative minor of a major, say C Major, is the sixth note, in this case A

Minor Scale Formula:
1-2 W
2-3 h
3-4 W
4-5 W
5-6 h
6-7 W 
7-8 W

What is the Key Signature for F Major
F Major Scale            : F G A Bb C D E F
Key Signature : Bb
Relative Minor (D Minor) : D E F G A Bb C D 

[ Intervals ]
interval - the distance between 2 notes
In a scale :
1-1 = unison
1-2 = major 2nd
1-3 = major 3rd
1-4 = perfect 4th
1-5 = perfect 5th
1-6 = major 6th
1-7 = major 7th
1-8 = octave

What is a major 3rd up from D?
D E F# G A B C# : F #

[ Sharpen or Flatten Intervals ]
flatten Maj 2 => Min 2
flatten Maj 3 => Min 3

Sharpen Maj 2 => Aug 2
Sharpen Maj 3 => Aug 3

(perfect intervals)
flatten perfect 4th => diminished 4th
flatten perfect 5th => diminished 5th
sharpen perfect 4th => augmented 4th
sharpen perfect 5th => augmented 5th

Ex: 
C -> D = Major 2nd
C -> Db = Minor 2nd
C -> D# = Augmented 2nd

What is the interval G -> Eb?
Minor 6th

What is the interval B -> F?
B -> F = perfect fifth. 
In B Major Scale, perfect 5th is F#
So interval from B -> F is diminished 5h

What is the interval Ab -> G
Interval Ab -> G = 1-7th
In the Ab scale, G is a major 7th
