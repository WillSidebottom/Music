Intro to chords

Chord -  3 or more unique notes played simultaneously
Triad - Chords with 3 notes stacked in thirds
Example C Major Triad = C E G
	C -> E = Major Third
	E -> G = Minor Third
	
	G = 5
	E = 3
	C = 1

Major Triad:
- has major 3rd (C -> E)
- has perfect 5th (C -> G)

Minor Triad
- has minor 3rd (C -> Eb)
- has perfect 5th (C -> G)

Augmented Triad
- has a major 3rd (C -> E)
- has a augmented 5th (C -> G#)

Diminished Triad
- has a minor 3rd (C -> Eb)
- has a diminished 5th (C -> Gb)

What kind of Triad is D F A
- minor 3rd
- perfect 5th 
- Minor Triad

What kind of Triad is G B D#
- B is major 3rd
- D # is augmented 5th
G Augmented Triad

Find the triads in the key of C
C D E F G A B C
C - C E G - Major
D - D F A - Minor
E - E G B - Minor 
F - F A C - Major 3rd / perfect 5th - Major
G - G B D - Major 3rd / perfect 5th - Major
A - A C E - Minor 3rd / perfect 5th - Minor
B - B D F - Minor 3rd / diminished 5th - Dim

Find the tirads in the key of D
D E F# G A B C# D
D - D F# A - Major 3rd / perfect 5th - Major
E - E G B - Minor 3rd / perfect 5th - Minor
F# - F# A C - Minor 3rd / perfect 5th - Minor
G - G B D - Major 3rd / perfect 5th - Major
A - A C# E - Major 3rd / perfedt 5th - Major
B - B D F# - Minor 3rd / perfect 5th - Minor
C# - C# E G - Minor 3rd / diminshed 5th - Diminished

[ four note chords - adding a 7th ]
C E G B - ( Major triad + Major 7) C Major 7
C E G Bb - (Major triad + Minor 7) C7 or C dominant 7
C Eb G Bb - (Minor triad + Minor 7) C Minor 7
C Eb Gb Bb - (Diminished triad + Minor 7) C Minor 7 b5 (half diminished)
C Eb Gb Bbb - C Diminished 7 or fully diminished (7 is double flatted or diminished)

[ What type of chord is this]
C E G B
- C E G (major triad)
- B = major 7th
- Cmaj7

D F A C
- D F A = min triad
- C = minor 7th
- Dmin7

E G B D
- E G B = min triad
- D = minor 7th
- Emin7

F A C E
- F A C = maj triad
- E = maj 7th
- Fmaj7

G B D F
- Maj triad
- Min 7th
- G7

A C E G
- Min triad
- Min 7th
- A min 7

B D F A
- Diminished triad
- Min 7
- B min 7 b5

[ Modifications - Suspensions, 6th chords, tensions, altered tensions]
C Major Triad
1 3 5
C E G

Suspending - lower the thrid to maj 2nd or raise third to perfect 4th
1 3 5 => 1 4 5 or 1 2 5
Example 
CSus4 = suspended third to perfect 4th
CSus2 = suspended third to major 2nd

Same thing can be applied to minor chords

G triad G B D 
(G A B C D E F# G)
So,
GSus4 is G C D
GSus2 is G A D

D minor into DSus4
D E F# G A B C# D
D minor triad = D F A
DSus4 = D G A

Amaj => ASus2
A B C# D E F# G# A
A C# E => A B E

[ Sixth Chords - Replace the perfect 5th with major 6 or minor 6 ]
1 3 6 - Major6
1 b3 6 - Minor6

Example
Major  1 3 5
	   C E G
C6 : C E G => C E A
Cmin6 : C E G => C Eb A

Turn B into B6
B D# F# => B D# G#

Turn Dmin into Dmin6
D F# A => D F A => D F B

[ Adding Tensions - adding other notes (2 4 6) from scale to chord - Extensions ]
1     2  3    4   5   6  7
root  9  3rd  11  5th 13 7th

Cmaj7 = C E G B
Cmaj7(9) = Cmaj7 + 2 = C E G B D
( Not to be confused with tensions where we replace the 2 - We Are Adding It!)
Cmaj7(11) = Cmaj7 + 4 = C E G B F

What notes are in a Gmaj7(9) chord
G A B C D E F# G
G B D F# A

What are the notes in Fmin7(11) chord
F G A Bb C D E F
F Ab C Eb Bb

[ Altering Tensions : Sharpen + Flatten Tensions]
D7(9) = D F# A C B
So, D7(#9) (D7 sharp 9) = D F# A C B#
D7(b13) = D F# A C Bb
